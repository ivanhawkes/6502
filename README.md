# 6502 Assembler Programs

This contains an assortment of 6502 software I am writing. Most or all of it will be targetted at the [Ben Eater 6502 project](https://eater.net/6502).

The documentation for the assembler is in the VASM folder.

Instructions on how to build are within the assembler code at the top of the main source file.
